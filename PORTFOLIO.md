## TODO

In May 2023, I refactored my site to use the new `app/` directory in Next.js 13. I went ahead and shipped it, but there are still a few errors I want to fix:

- No Issues as for now.

You can learn more about the `app/` directory [here](https://nextjs.org/docs).

## Running Locally

This application requires Node.js v16.13+ and Next.js 13.4+ .

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s2sharpit/s2sharpit.github.io.git
cd s2sharpit.github.io
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env.local` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/s2sharpit/s2sharpit.github.io/blob/next/.env.example).
